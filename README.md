  <h1>Why Should We Incorporate Social Factors Into Evacuation Planning?</h1>

Socially vulnerable populations tend to have higher risks of damage when responding to and recovering from wildfires. We determine social vulnerability by factors such as age, income, education, and health.

<h2>How Social Factors Affect Evacuation Behavior</h2>

Research by Dulebenets et al. shows that individuals who are 65 years or oder drive XX% slower than individuals 25 years in evacuation scenarios.

Additionally, the elderly are more at risk of perishing from wildfires. People over the age of 65 made up 80% of fatalities in the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, CA.

<h2>How Social Factors Affect Risk to Wildfire Damage and Recovery</h2>

More than 80% of older homes (houses built prior to 2008) and mobile homes were destroyed in the Camp Fire, compared to the 49% of newer homes that were burnt down.

<h2>How are Evacuations Currently Planned?</h2>

Primarily based on biophysical indicators, such as WHP. (Show WHP Map)
