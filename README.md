  <h1>Why Should We Incorporate Social Factors Into Evacuation Planning?</h1>

While evacuation planning typically measures risk by using traditional biophysical indicators, such as fuel, weather and geography, it does not factor in the different risks that different people may face. Research has shown that socially vulnerable populations tend to be at a higher risk when responding to and recovering from wildfires. We determine social vulnerability by factors such as age, income, education, and health.

<h2>How Social Factors Affect Evacuations</h2>

Socially vulnerable populations can face additional difficulties when evacuting from wildfires. If we look at old age as an example,

Research by Dulebenets et al. shows that individuals who are 65 years or older drive XX% slower than individuals 25 years in evacuation scenarios.

Additionally, the elderly are more at risk of perishing from wildfires. People over the age of 65 made up 80% of fatalities in the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, CA.

<h2>How Social Factors Affect Damage Recovery from Wildfires</h2>

More than 80% of older homes (houses built prior to 2008) and mobile homes were destroyed in the Camp Fire, compared to the 49% of newer homes that were burnt down.
